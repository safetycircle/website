Got a mobile phone? How many times a day does it grab your attention? It's so frequent for many of us that it's automatic and uncontrolled. That attention we give it is often needed on the road, or that oncoming truck, or on the swinging load or where our feet are about to step. 

The smarter the phone, the bigger the distraction. It's designed to grab your eyeballs and brain. And if we don't control our technology, then it controls us - often putting us at risk. Too many people have already died, or ended up quadruplegic, or badly hurt because someone lost focus when their phone goes off with a text, email, call or Facebook chime. It's a killer hiding in our pocket, we carry it around, and it clawing at our attention. 

On work sites there are times when we MUST have "no phones on" - does your site ever have that conversation and agreements or rules? If so, respect it and uphold it - it could save your life and maybe someone else's. If not, how about identifying when the highest risk tasks are and bringing it up at the next toolbox or work group meeting? Have it out with people who are just SO distracted that they're a menace; to safety, to team work, to themselves? Or is it an unwritten code that everyone gets away with casual phone use as long as the job gets done and our luck holds? This is one Work Health and Safety issue that needs us all to bring it back into balance. On our work sites AND on our roads. It's even more dangerous letting your phone get the better of you when you're driving. Get a grip, it's your life and you have the most to lose if you make the kind of dumb choice this 22 year old in USA made - texting while driving he ran off the road, rolled the vehicle and got killed - here's a photo of the text he was writing as he lost focus on the road - worth dying for? No way. It's a dumb way to die. Get control of your mobile phone. 

For a few graphic reminders of just how dangerous it is, check out this VW road safety commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHixeIr_6BM

And if that doesn't make enough difference - try this YouTube clip - it's from an English construction site where a fatality occurred. It was made as part of the court's ruling to penalise the employer, SGB/Harsco - they have to make it available worldwide for free to educate workers on the perils of mobile phones being used on site. It's a well-made analysis of the "what if's" we get great feedback when we use it in WHS training.  Here's the link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMWOa5DH08 - it's 24 minutes long - so give yourself time. 

Plus, if your wife or girlfriend or daughter are stuck in bad phone habits while driving... watch this British road safety ad with her (warning! it's not for the faint hearted). The link is:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?list=WL&v=R0LCmStIw9E
