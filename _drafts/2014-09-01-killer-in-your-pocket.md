Got a mobile phone? For interest's sake, estimate how many times a day it succeeds in grabbing your attention? 10? 20? 50? For me, I'd say it's 30-40 times a day.

It's so frequent for many of us that it's automatic and uncontrolled. That attention we give the phone is the same attention needed for our eyes to be on the road, or that oncoming truck when we're crossing the road, or on the swinging load or where our feet are about to step. 

And the smarter the phone, the bigger the distraction. Smart phones are designed to attract our eyes, ears and mind. And we set them up specially to interrupt us with special tones, vibrations and flashes! Of course mobile technology is incredibly useful, that's why we become so attached and attuned. It can save our lives as well as our time. 

But if we don't control our technology, then it controls us - often putting us at risk. Too many people have already died, or ended up quadruplegic, or badly hurt because someone lost focus when their phone went off with a text, email, call or Facebook chime. 
### _"Your phone is a potential killer hiding in your pocket, you carry it around, and it claws for your attention, day in day out. Mine too - that's how I know."_

On work sites there are times when we MUST have "no phones". Does your work group ever have that conversation and make agreements or rules? Does your supervisor ever confront this real-life safety issue? If so, respect it and uphold it - keeping that agreement could save your life and maybe someone else's. If not, how about identifying when the highest risk tasks are and bringing it up at the next toolbox or work group meeting? 

In SafetyCircle organisations we make agreements, and give each other permission to interrupt our unsafe or unhealthy acts. Unsafe phone use clearly qualifies. 

But what often happens when some-one sees a phone-user who is SO distracted that they're a menace; to their own safety, to team work, or to others' safety? Too often we shrug and 'tut tut' knowlingly. In some workplaces and in public there seems to be an unwritten code that everyone gets away with casual phone use as long as the job gets done and our luck holds. 

This is one Work Health and Safety issue that needs us all to bring it back into balance. On our work sites AND on our roads. It's even more dangerous letting your phone get the better of you when you're driving. Get a grip, it's your life and you have the most to lose. Please stop making the kind of dumb choice this 22 year old in USA made - texting while driving he ran off the road, rolled the vehicle and got killed - here's a photo of the text he was writing as he lost focus on the road...

Was it worth dying for? No way. It's a dumb way to die. Get control of your mobile phone. 

For a brilliant reminder of just how fast and dangerous it is, check out this VW road safety commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHixeIr_6BM

Or watch this YouTube clip - it's from an English construction site where a fatality occurred. It was made as part of the court's ruling to penalise the employer, SGB/Harsco - they have to make it available worldwide for free to educate workers on the perils of mobile phones being used on site. It's a well-made analysis of the "what if's" when some-one answers the phone when needing to stay focused on the job. We get great feedback when we use it in WHS training.  Here's the link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMWOa5DH08 - it's 17 minutes long - so give yourself time. 

Plus, if your wife or girlfriend or daughter are stuck in bad phone habits while driving... watch this British road safety ad with her (warning! it's not for the faint hearted). The link is:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?list=WL&v=R0LCmStIw9E
