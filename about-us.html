				<h2>The SafetyCircle team are proven specialists in WHS consulting and training. </h2>
				<p>They are coaches who set high standards and then enable teams and individuals to reach those standards. The SafetyCircle team is committed to injury and illness prevention and makes this possible for clients. They work hard as innovators and simplifiers looking to make sense and make a difference in a field that is often dogged by paperwork overload, fear-mongering, zealotry and complacency. </p>

				<p>Each member of the SafetyCircle team possesses a rare skill set and level of experience required to pass a most rigorous selection criteria - which makes becoming a SafetyCircle trainer a difficult and extraordinary qualification that does not suit most trainers or consultants. The company appreciates that cultural change work is a steep challenge requiring only the best trainers to lead the programs.</p>
