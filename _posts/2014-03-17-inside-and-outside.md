During the construction of the SafetyCircle web pages our web designer Rami Yahya of SmithAssociates (www.smithassociates.com)devised this wonderful new image of “Inside and Outside” the SafetyCircle – for those who know how the SafetyCircle sessions go, this looks a bit different than how we draw the distinctions of the SafetyCircle – but all the words and intent is the same and we love it – thanks so much Rami and Rowan at SmithAssociates.

Here are a couple of images of recent SafetyCircles drawn and workshopped by groups in SafetyCircle sessions. And our 2014 “Ins and Outs” summary handout for participants if you are looking to update your reminder printouts.
