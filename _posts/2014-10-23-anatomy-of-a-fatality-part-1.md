## _“We were running behind. We thought we had to push on regardless.”_

It’s eerie. Statements like this come up all too often when investigators like me  interview co-workers at a fatal incident scene. As an incident investigator and safety culture consultant I get to see where and why organisations and humans fail – and pay the ultimate price. 

We, humans, fail to follow the instructions or procedures; fail to see the warning flags; fail to learn from incidents, near-misses and hazard reports; fail to listen and respond to genuine safety complaints. Here's a photo taken from an office window in Sydney, of a guy pushing his luck that day.

Any discussion of workplace safety must confront the notions of **luck, complacency and personal choices**. These are human factors.

21st century work health and safety focuses on “higher order controls” – primarily equipment and system design issues. They are critically important to enable a safe, efficient, modern organisation to get its job done. 

But **EQUIPMENT**, the entire hardware of the organisation; and **SYSTEMS**; the ‘how’ we intend procedures to get done, are **extremely dependent on PEOPLE**; that is, the ‘who’ we have doing the work.

I have illustrated this dependency in a new diagram (see below). It conveys how I now see this E.S.P. relationship, from reviewing and investigating hundreds of workplace safety incidents.

You see, your organisation or work group can have the best possible equipment and facilities, they can have gold standard systems, but if your people aren’t ‘right’ you're riding your luck on safety. By the ‘right’ people, I mean people who stay ‘switched on’ when they need to be, or who accept coaching and correction rather than resisting or rejecting it. Workers and Supervisors don't have the 'right' mindset if they fail to listen and learn, fail to see and heed warning signs (actual and metaphoric). This is especially true for who we at SafetyCircle call ‘Leaders’ – your executives, managers, supervisors, team leaders and so on. If the Leaders are so focused on getting the job done that safety is peripheral, you’re riding for a fall; it's only a matter of time.

I’ve drawn this as a broad **Y** symbol to illustrate that WHS Performance can only stand up if your people provide a broad enough, sensible enough, strong enough base for the equipment to work well, and the systems to be operated well. The fewer suitable, 'switched on' people you have, the narrower the base is and the less stable your WHS efforts and performance will be. Please let me know if this makes sense to you - or if you don't agree (and post comments below).

I was recently involved in investigating a tragic fatality at a construction workplace. The two men doing the work made up a ‘work around’ method when the Equipment, 4 tonne excavator with a grab attachment, was off site for the day. They departed from the approved work method and failed to communicate this change to the principal contractor or other leaders on site (System failures). Their work ethic to ‘get it done’ is laudable, but their lack of communication and disrespect for safe processes is deplorable. Using an ad hoc method for lifting 6 metre steel I-beams, a worn out untested cloth sling (when a chain grab was needed), attached at the wrong point of the small excavator, they pushed their luck too far, and one died when the worn-out sling broke and the 6 metre steel beam fell onto him.

It’s so sad and unnecessary. That’s why in the SafetyCircle Program we empower Workers to say ‘No’, ‘Wait’, ‘Is it safe enough?’ and to STOP WORK if it’s not safe enough. Because who are the most likely people to need and use those simple words to save their life. SafetyCircle also trains and develops Leaders to build a speak-up culture, to listen well and to be responsive. As part of our leadership program we teach ‘Language for Change’.
