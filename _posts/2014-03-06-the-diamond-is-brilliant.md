HCC Supervisors welcome SafetyCircle’s simple tool.

Hobart City Council engaged SafetyCircle with a full two-year SafetyCircle Program in January 2013.

The cultural transformation HCC was looking for included supporting HCC leaders to performance manage more effectively, especially breaches of WHS rules and procedures.

Working with Human Resources and Divisional leaders we customised the SafetyCircle “Diamond” [a one page summary of disciplinary processes and positive recognition approaches] – so it mirrored and simplified the required HCC process.

The “Diamond” approach is then explained and practiced in one of the SafetyCircle Leadership Development Program sessions called “Draw the Line”. As committed SafetyCirclers know, ‘the line’ is the choice-boundary between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour/risk/controls.
 
Through the sessions with over a hundred HCC Leaders to date, the “Diamond” has received praise for clarifying a previously bewildering process within Council. “It makes it do-able.” and “What a relief!” were frequent feedback pieces given at the end of that session. Along with the simple SafetyCircle language and prompts, HCC leaders are reporting that their ability to engage with workers on the harder conversations of pulling people into line are made easier when they use the SafetyCircle Diamond.
 
For SafetyCircle clients who have not had the “Draw the Line” process in their workplace and would like it, please contact your SafetyCircle Leader (Michael, Martyn or Drew) to see how to get it into your SafetyCircle Leadership development.
