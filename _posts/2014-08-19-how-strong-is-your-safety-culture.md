SafetyCircle's survey and analysis gives you powerful insights and measures of your organisation's WHS Culture. Answering 35 culturally telling questions, workers and leaders provide a fascinating view of the workplace culture in 6 key cultural factor areas:

1. Response to Pressure
2. WHS Leadership
3. Fairness, Responsibility and Just Culture
4. Risk Management
5. WHS Communication
6. WHS Resourcing

The survey tool and the analysis process has been designed and validated in conjunction with Dr Ben Brooks of the University of Tasmania, Australian Maritime College; PhD in Human Factors.
