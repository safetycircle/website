Fifteen years of WHS Progress in difficult times. Forestry Tasmania benefits from SafetyCircle and IPM Safety.

Forestry Tasmania’s WHS and Workers Compensation manager Kiran Mudaliar recently shared with us the graph showing the remarkable trend in Lost Time injuries suffered by FT employees and contractors over the past 20 years. 

IPM Safety first began working with FT in 1998 on a variety of injury management and injury prevention projects. FT was an early adopter of the SafetyCircle and has been committed to it since 2006. The graph shows a remarkable trend during a time when FT has encountered an incredible range of internal and external challenges. 

It’s a complete credit to the strength of the leadership and workforce culture at FT that during such a turbulent period they have managed to keep themselves and each other from many serious injuries. In our experience, when the winds of change and media frenzy occurs such as FT has encountered in the past 10 years, then the workforce tends to fall apart, physically and mentally. 

Workers Compensation claims and lost time injuries usually rise significantly through such periods. Despite any environmental differences held, IPM Safety, led by Specialist WHS Consultant Michael Roberts committed to assisting the FT workforce to “stay safe and well” through employing the SafetyCircle principles. 

During our 2011 UTAS/Enterprise Connect Researcher in Business Project, assessing the WHS Culture of 7 SafetyCircle organisations, Forestry Tasmania showed the strongest WHS Culture of all, in all 6 cultural factors. 

During 2014, FT staff across Tasmania will again be doing a customised SafetyCircle Refresher Program to keep the momentum going. We congratulate FT on this exceptional performance.
