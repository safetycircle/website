The growing Roadways Limited group have found a new way to keep reinforcing the SafetyCircle message.
They’ve designed, produced and issued new caps to their 100 strong workforce incorporating the SafetyCircle logo and message. Since 2008 Roadways have been strengthening and improving their health and safety performance, inspired and guided by SafetyCircle’s simple and powerful messages. 

As a token of appreciation Roadways recently sent SafetyCircle co-creator Martyn Bradfield this cap. What other ideas can you come up with to remind, refresh and reinforce your workforce to “work inside the SafetyCircle”?
