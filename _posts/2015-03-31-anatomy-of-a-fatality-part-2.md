## Understanding the "ESP" of Positive WHS
In Part 1 of this article I discussed the need for correct equipment; the “E” of our ESP model of what good WHS takes. To summarise: in the fatality I was involved in investigating in early 2013, the equipment related issues included: i) having a smaller excavator; ii) without a grab attachment for the I-beams; iii) using a worn out cloth sling (and riggers tell me chains would have been more suitable); and iv) attaching it to an incorrect lifting point on the excavator bucket.

Each of these equipment issues is clearly connected, and each presented an opportunity for saying “No.” or “Stop.” Or “Let’s check.” if either of the worker’s safety culture had been stronger than the “just get it done” culture that ruled that fateful day. 
(excavator pictured was not the one involved in this incident – incident still under investigation by the coroner)
### “S” is for Systems. 
Which systems failed or where did the operations not meet required standards? On that day the construction site’s risk management systems were tested and sorely failed. When the large excavator with the grab attachment was not available, then the Standard Procedure for handling the I-beams became invalid. No change was made to risk assess the changed work process. In fact the Standard Procedure made available by the contractor for handling the 6 metre long I-beams was generic – it had not been customised or even validated/signed that it was relevant and covered working at a tip site with methane pockets and on unstable sloping ground. So there were clear failures of the “system” documentation. The legally required process of a risk assessment being required when there is a change in the work that may affect the health and safety of anyone on site. A simple “Stop and Think” process could have saved this man’s life. 
There had been an additional “warning flag” – in SafetyCircle we call them “Red Flags”. An incident one month prior to the fatality involving an excavator attachment breaking during use and striking an operator on the foot, had been reported but poorly investigated by the contractor’s supervisor. The principal contractor’s WHS incident review system also failed to identify this as a tell-tale warning sign that tighter procedural control and checking was needed.
"P" is for People
Lastly in the ESP is P for People (including culture). Under the circumstances of running behind schedule; of being a contractor of a contractor of a contractor of a contractor (i.e. 4 layers deep from the principal contractor) and having incorrect equipment and systems, there probably appeared to be little opportunity to prevent the tragic occurrence of that day. 
But there were real opportunities. What if the person attaching the sling had chosen to inspect it properly and identify it was badly worn out? What if the excavator operator had said “No, I’m not doing it that way” when the unsafe workaround method was proposed? What if the Principal Contractor’s system had picked up that the excavator contractor’s response to the prior incident was not good WHS practice – (they only fixed the broken part; there was no root cause analysis regarding safety system failures, substandard work practices and so on). 
These might seem to be “what if’s”, but in a workplace where a positive “Speak Up and Interrupt” culture has been built – such as we do in the SafetyCircle – these what if’s become immediate action because everyone recognises and takes action to get themselves and everyone else Home Safe and Well Today.

(note: this is not the actual sling involved in this incident, but another from a real workplace)
Worn cloth slings fray and break under load as this picture shows. This is a perfect example of the inter-connectedness of ESP. If the equipment is fatigued, and the systems for checking safety-critical equipment are deficient or absent, and the people haven’t got a “Stop and Think” culture (i.e. let’s check the gear instead of assuming it’s all fine) – then nothing is defending the incident from playing out. Investigation methods and models such as Reason’s, ICAM and the Loss Control Model seek to find absent or deficient “defences” – hence our role as safety professionals is to build, test, verify and strengthen such defences. The SafetyCircle is designed to resolve workers’ participation in speaking up about WHS issues, saying “No.” or “Stop.” or “Let’s check.” and interrupting each other’s unsafe acts. Most importantly the SafetyCircle Program is designed to build and inspire the leadership skills in top and mid-level managers and supervisors so that “Get the job done safely” becomes the default setting across the whole operation. And strong workplace leaders do not assume “It’s fine.” They look for and double-check for signs of complacency, short-cutting and poor risk control. They use ESP to understand their role in making the work safe.
